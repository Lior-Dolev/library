# Contributers Guide

## Imports

type imports:

```jsx
// Good
import type { FC } from 'react';
import { type FC, useState } from 'react';

// Bad
import { FC } from 'react';
import { FC, useState } from 'react';

```

MUI imports:

```jsx
// Good
import { Box } from '@mui/material';

// Bad
import Box from '@mui/material/Box';
```

## Styling

Our components are mostly based on MUI components.
Every theme change should be included in Theme package.

## Dependencies

When we add or change dependencies:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
1. Make sure the package fills all the requirements
2. Add/update an MDX file to your story that compares between 3 most known libraries
and why you chose this one.
Comparison parameters:
    1. Package size
    2. Count of weekly downloads
3. Use fixed version of package - prefer `"react": "18.18.0"` over `"react": "^18.18.0"`
