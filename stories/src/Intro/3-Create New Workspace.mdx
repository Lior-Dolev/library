# Create New Workspace

## New Workspace Setup

1. Create a new folder under `packages` for your workspace
2. Copy & paste the following files from another workspace:

   - `package.json`
   - `tsconfig.json`
   - `vite.config.ts`

3. In your `package.json`:

   - Change the name to fit your workspace, for example: `@horus-library/your-component`
   - Remove dependencies you don't need

4. Add `src` folder and `index.ts` file inside it
5. In your `index.ts` file - paste the following mock:

   ```jsx
   // src/index.ts
   const mock = () => <div>hello world</div>;
   export default mock;
   ```

6. In root folder run the following commands:

   - `npm i` - to create a new link from root `node_modules` to your workspace `dist` folder
   - `npm run build --workspace @horus-library/your-component` - to build your workspace

7. In `stories` workspace:

   - In `package.json` file - add your workspace as a dependency
   - Create a new simple story for your component as the following mock:

     ```jsx
     // stories/src/YourComponent.stories.tsx
     import type { Meta, Story } from '@storybook/react';
     import YourComponent from '@horus-library/your-component';

     const meta = {
       title: 'Components/YourComponent',
       component: YourComponent,
       tags: ['autodocs'],
     } as Meta<typeof YourComponent>;

     export default meta;

     export const Default: Story = {
       args: {},
     };
     ```

8. In root folder - open 2 terminal windows:
   - first terminal window - run `npm run start` command to run storybook - you should see your new story under Components folder
   - second retminal window - run `npm run watch --workspace @horus-library/your-component` command to enable you watch your changes in your stories as you develop. (try to change `hello world` to another text to make sure it works)
