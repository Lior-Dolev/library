# Contributor Introduction

Welcome to our library!

## Setup

Run these commands from root folder:

```npm
npm i

npm run build

npm run start
```

## Monorepo Introduction

This project is built as a monorepo - multiple micro packages that work togther.

Each package of a monorepo is called a **workspace**.

**Monorepo benefits:**

- Each workspace can be built and published independetly
- Workspaces can install each other locally as their latest version,
  without the need to publish them first and then install the latest package later
- `npm` creates a smart `node_modules` folder structure which shares dependencies accross workspaces.
  For example - if every workspace has `react` dependency - `npm` will install it once.
- It's much easier to manage all workspaces in one place - keep the same guidelines, examples, etc.

## How it works (Setup explained)

When we run `npm i` in root folder:

- `npm` will install all dependencies as we know
- `npm` will install all workspaces dependencies
- `npm` will create a link folder for every workspace - this link folder will point to `workspace/dist` folder,
  which at the beginning will be empty.

How does `npm` knows what are our workspaces? We defined it in root `package.json` as the following example:

```npm
"workspaces": [
    "packages/*",
    "stories"
  ]
```

When we run `npm build` in root folder:

- `npm` will look for `build` command in root `package.json` and will find: `lerna run build`
- `lerna run build` (a CLI command based on `@lerna/run` package) will run `build` command for every workspace

Alternatively we could've run `npm run build --workspaces` which runs `build` command for every workspace,
but `npm run` command runs in alphabetic order, whereas `lerna run` command considers the dependency tree,
which means that if `PackageA` installs `PackageB` in its dependencies then it will know to run `build` for `PackageB` before `PackageA`.

When we run `npm run start` in root folder:

- `npm` will look for `start` command in root `package.json` and will find: `npm run start --workspace @horus-library/stories`
- `npm run start --workspace @horus-library/stories` will run `npm run start` in `@horus-library/stories` workspace -
  which will run storybook

## Project Structure

All packages can be found under `packages/*` folder.

All stories will be written separatly in `stories` workspace.

`stories` workspace will install every other workspace - that way our stories will use these components exactly like the user will!

## Developer watch mode

When we run storybook as developers who want to watch our component as we create and modify it -
we want to see the changes immediately.

The issue with that is that `stories` installs our component as a dependency,
and it won't see any changes unless we run `npm run build` for our workspace.

To fix that we'll also run our workspace in watch mode:

```npm
// first terminal window - run storybook in root folder
npm run start

// second terminal window - run `your-component` in watch mode (in root folder as well)
npm run watch --workspace @horus-library/your-component

```
